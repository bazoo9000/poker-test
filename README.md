# poker-test
Progression of base card game and implementing and testing poker to see if it works, it may work with any other card game like UNO, Makao, etc.
It's also a way for me to apply what I have learned about STL in C++.

How to play this poker: 
- you have 5 cards
- you may choose wich cards to keep (0 to keep)
- and wich cards to discard and change (1 to change)
- you have to input 5 numbers (ex: 1 0 0 1 1)
- it will show the new cards (if changed) and give you the result
- to play again you have to close and re-open the .exe (no loops for the moment)
